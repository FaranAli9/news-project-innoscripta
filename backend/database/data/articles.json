Back then, the address was just outside of Chinatown, which emerged in the 1870s within the predominantly Irish and later Italian Five Points slum, at the bracket of Bayard, Mott and Pell Streets. The New York Times first mentions the neighborhood by name in 1880, coolly noting that a few property owners in the area refused to take Chinese tenants, while others demanded rents \u201cconsiderably above those paid by Christians.\u201d These days, depending on whom you ask, the neighborhood sprawls from Delancey Street down to Chambers Street, west to Broadway and east as far as the river.","link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/09\/19\/t-magazine\/manhattan-chinatown-neighborhood.html","image":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/images\/2023\/09\/19\/t-magazine\/19tmag-chinatown-slide-YMVE-copy\/19tmag-chinatown-slide-YMVE-copy-articleLarge.jpg","published_at":"2023-09-19 09:01:05","created_at":"2023-11-08 15:18:44","updated_at":"2023-11-08 15:19:35"},{"id":1290,"author_id":265,"source_id":18,"category_id":1,"title":"Home for N.Y.U.\u2019s Art Treasures Gets a New Name and Space","summary":"Who knew New York University even had a dedicated art museum?","link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/09\/14\/arts\/design\/grey-art-gallery-nyu-renamed.html","image":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/images\/2023\/09\/18\/multimedia\/13grey-art-museum-nyu-tkzq\/13grey-art-museum-nyu-tkzq-articleLarge.jpg","published_at":"2023-09-14 17:47:57","created_at":"2023-11-08 15:18:44","updated_at":"2023-11-08 15:18:44"},{"id":1291,"author_id":266,"source_id":18,"category_id":1,"title":"The Big City Where Housing Is Still Affordable","summary":"Yuta Yamasaki and his wife moved from southern Japan to Tokyo a decade ago because job prospects were better in the big city.

That includes the opening of a clutch of new hotels, like Farasha Farmhouse, a four-room boutique property. Formerly an artist\u2019s private retreat, Farasha, which lies 30 minutes outside of the city center, is the vision of Rosena and Fred Charmoy. The Marrakesh-based couple are the founders of Boutique Souk \u2014 a local high-end events company popular with visiting celebrities and fashion brands (their client list includes Chanel and Saint Laurent) \u2014 and are known for their theatrical, over-the-top parties and weddings. Farasha, though, is a more tranquil endeavor. \u201cWe loved the mountain views on both sides of the property,\u201d says Rosena, referring to the Atlas and Jbilet ranges that appear to envelop the acres of olive groves and herb gardens. The two-story main building, which holds three suites and the soaring, open-plan common space, is complemented by a neighboring stand-alone cottage. To furnish the place, the Charmoys turned to local creative friends: floors are laid with custom tapestries from Beni Rugs; sculptures were installed by the Moroccan contemporary artist Amine El Gotaibi; and the book collection comes from the family estate of Diana Vreeland, the legendary former editor of Vogue, donated to the hotel by her son Freck, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Morocco. Food here is similarly considered, overseen by the chef Aniss Meski. The olive oil is made on-site, most vegetable dishes use the farm\u2019s produce and a flock of chickens provides a daily supply of fresh eggs. And if the prospect of snagging one of only four guest rooms seems like a tall challenge, fear not: six more will be available to book starting next year.

Westerly Canteen\u2019s trailer holds a compact kitchen with cream-painted walls and blond wood counters. \u201cI had this wild idea, like, \u2018What if we took the food truck concept and put it in a space that is still mobile but feels beautiful and welcoming?\u2019\u201d Levine said as she stirred a pot of golden-hued stock, fragrant with spring onion and green garlic. Levine, who previously worked at the Berkeley, Calif., restaurant Chez Panisse, founded Westerly with her partner, Alex Kaindl, a farmer who tends half an acre in Sharon, Conn. Nearly all of their ingredients are sourced from farms nearby. (Starting this month, Kaindl\u2019s crops will also be incorporated.) Developing the weekly menu is a puzzle that requires maximizing limited space and resources. \u201cA lot of our decisions are very creative and passion driven but also very practical,\u201d Kaindl said as Levine ladled the stock over a plate of nettle-stuffed ravioli. \u201cWe slice up the spring onions that go into the dish, and the tops are made into the broth,\u201d Levine said. \u201cWe\u2019re using every piece of the onion.\u201d The founders hope to engage the surrounding community while also drawing diners from afar. They\u2019ve partnered with Tenmile Distillery, which offers cocktails made with local ingredients to go alongside Westerly\u2019s menu (their take on a Negroni includes Faccia Brutto bitters from Brooklyn, Method sweet vermouth from Romulus and gin made on-site at Tenmile). \u201cWe really want people to sit here and stay a while,\u201d Levine said. westerlycanteen.com.","link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/07\/06\/t-magazine\/hawaii-surfboards-bizia-oahu.html","image":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/images\/2023\/07\/07\/t-magazine\/entertainment\/7tmag-t-list-slide-1F0M-copy\/7tmag-t-list-slide-1F0M-articleLarge.jpg","published_at":"2023-07-06 13:00:12","created_at":"2023-11-08 15:19:47","updated_at":"2023-11-08 15:19:47"},{"id":1348,"author_id":312,"source_id":18,"category_id":2,"title":"Ticket Giants, Under Pressure From Biden, Promise Transparency on Fees","summary":"Under pressure from the Biden administration, some of the biggest companies that handle ticketing for concerts and other live events announced on Thursday that they will make it easier for consumers to see the full price of tickets they want to buy, including the fees that can often add more than 30 percent to the total cost of an order.","link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/06\/15\/arts\/music\/live-nation-ticketmaster-junk-fees.html","image":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/images\/2023\/06\/15\/multimedia\/15TICKETS-vgmk\/15TICKETS-vgmk-articleLarge.jpg","published_at":"2023-06-15 15:50:22","created_at":"2023-11-08 15:19:47","updated_at":"2023-11-08 15:19:47"},{"id":1349,"author_id":274,"source_id":18,"category_id":2,"title":"Diablo IV Breaks Blizzard Records, Surpassing \u2018$666 Million\u2019 in Sales","summary":"Diablo IV, the latest version of a video game franchise that has gained millions of fans over its more than 25 years, has broken internal records for its publisher Blizzard and surpassed more than $666 million in sales since its debut on June 6.","link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/06\/12\/technology\/diablo-iv-video-game-sales.html","image":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/images\/2023\/06\/13\/multimedia\/12Diablo-print-bgmt\/12Diablo-sub-bgmt-articleLarge.jpg","published_at":"2023-06-12 20:05:09","created_at":"2023-11-08 15:19:47","updated_at":"2023-11-08 15:19:47"},{"id":1350,"author_id":313,"source_id":18,"category_id":2,"title":"Will Children Save Us at the End of the World?","summary":"The noxious orange smoke that descended over New York this month reminded me of a parlor game I used to play with my husband: Would we have what it takes to survive the apocalypse?
